## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can arise from various behaviors. Below are common actions that can contribute to it:

- Verbal Harassment: This includes making sexually explicit comments, jokes, or using suggestive language. Prevention involves fostering a culture of respect and professionalism, coupled with education.

- Unwanted Advances: This encompasses unwelcome sexual propositions, advances, or requests. Prevention involves promoting clear communication about boundaries, consent, and respectful relationships.

- Physical Harassment: This involves unwanted sexual contact like touching, groping, or assault. Prevention measures include enforcing policies against physical harassment, promoting boundaries and consent, and offering self-defense training.

- Non-Verbal Harassment: This includes displaying sexual behavior, leering, or making explicit gestures. Prevention involves discouraging behaviors that make others uncomfortable and educating on respectful non-verbal communication.

- Sexual Coercion: This entails using one's power or authority to pressure someone into sexual activity. Prevention includes robust policies against harassment and abuse of power, fostering accountability and transparency, and training on recognizing and addressing coercion.

- Cyber Harassment: This involves sending unwanted sexual messages, explicit images, or engaging in online stalking or harassment of a sexual nature. Prevention includes setting guidelines for online behavior, educating on online harassment, and implementing reporting mechanisms.
